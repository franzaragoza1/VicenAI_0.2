=== CHASSIS & AERO ===

Heave Springs (Third Elements):
- Control pitch sensitivity and ride height at high speed
- Stiffer heave = more stable aero platform, harsh over bumps

Anti-Roll Bars:
- Adjustable blade stiffness front/rear
- Tuning for corner entry/exit balance (Understeer/Oversteer)

Aero Map:
- Sensitive to rake angle (Rear RH - Front RH)
- Lower RH = More downforce (up to stall point)

=== ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS ===

Traction Control (TC):
- TC1: Longitudinal slip target (Wheelspin)
- TC2: Lateral cut/Gain (Slide angle)

Brake Bias:
- Adjusts hydraulic pressure distribution Front/Rear
- Migration: Shifts bias dynamically during braking phase

MGU-K:
- Modes: Qual, Race (Balanced), Attack, Build
- Regen: Passive on throttle lift and active on brake application
