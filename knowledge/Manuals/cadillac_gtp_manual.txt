=== OPERATION ===

Starting: Turn ignition, press starter, wait for revs to stabilize
Shifting: Paddle shift (Right Up / Left Down). Clutchless shifting once moving
Launch: Use clutch for initial getaway only. Anti-stall active
Hybrid Deploy: Automatic management via selected map modes

=== DASHBOARD DISPLAYS ===

RACE PAGE 1 & 2:
- Primary: Gear, Speed, RPM, Lap Time
- Hybrid Info: SoC (State of Charge), Deploy Mode, Virtual Tank
- Tire Data: Pressures (FL/FR/RL/RR) and Temperatures
- Systems: TC (Slip/Gain), ABS, Brake Bias, Fuel Level

QUAL PAGE:
- Focuses on Delta time and predictive lap info
- Simplifies engine status readouts

=== ADVANCED SETUP - AERO ===

Ride Heights:
- Critical for underfloor downforce generation
- Rake (Front vs Rear height difference) shifts Aero Balance
- Third Elements (Heave) support vertical aero loads to maintain stable platform

Aero Balance:
- Adjustable via Front Diffuser and Rear Wing angles
- Front Aero %: Higher = Oversteer at speed; Lower = Understeer

=== ADVANCED SETUP - CHASSIS ===

Suspension:
- Double wishbone pushrod front / pullrod rear (or vice versa per chassis spec)
- Springs/Dampers: 4-way adjustable (High/Low speed Bump/Rebound)
- ARB (Anti-Roll Bars): Control mechanical roll stiffness and balance

Tires:
- Michelin Pilot Sport. Pressure management crucial for contact patch and temp

=== POWER UNIT & HYBRID ===

MGU-K Modes:
- No Deploy: Qual/Practice only. Battery charging lap
- Qual: Max energy release over one lap
- Attack: High deploy for overtaking, drains SoC quickly
- Balanced: Standard Race mode, maintains SoC target
- Build: Rapid recharging mode

Brake System:
- Brake-by-Wire (BBW) system integrates regenerative braking
- Master Cylinder sizes affect pedal feel and modulation
