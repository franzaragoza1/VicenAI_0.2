=== TIRES ===

Tire Type:
- Dry: Slick for dry conditions
- Wet: Treaded for wet surfaces

Cold Pressure: Set on load. Higher = less drag/heat, less grip. Lower = more drag/heat, more grip. Start low and work upward

Hot Pressure: Compare to cold for balance. Heavier-loaded tires show larger difference. Adjust cold so similar tires reach similar hot pressures. Analyze after stabilization (~50% of fuel run)

Tire Temperatures: Carcass temps via Pyrometer. Center temps compare work. Inner/Outer analyze alignment (predominantly camber). Three zones: Inside, Middle, Outer

Tread Remaining: Identifies alignment issues. Use with temps for balance analysis. Same zones as temps

=== AERODYNAMICS ===

Front Mainplane Angle: Powerful for balance and total downforce. Increasing = more cornering capability medium-high speed, significant forward balance (oversteer), slight top speed reduction. Adjust with rear wing and rake. Reducing rake = rearward aero, increasing rake = forward aero

Rear Wing Angle: Primary purpose is trimming balance for front changes. Increasing = more downforce/drag, rearward balance (understeer). Less powerful than front for balance/downforce but more influential for drag. Long straights = may benefit from reduced rear angle for overtaking

Aero Calculator (reference tool - rear wing applies, heights don't):
- Rear RH at Speed: Input for calculations. Use average of LR/RR from telemetry for accuracy
- Downforce to Drag: Efficiency (downforce per unit drag). Doesn't represent total downforce
- Front Downforce: % on front axle. Instantaneous at exact parameters. Check multiple points (braking, steady state, exit) to understand balance movement. Higher forward % = oversteer mid-high speed

Note: Aero active in low-speed corners (effect lessened). Settings affecting dynamic heights also affect roll and mechanical balance

=== CHASSIS - FRONT ===

Pushrod Offset: Adjusts front height via pushrod length. Longer = higher, shorter = lower. Paired adjustment

ARB Blades: 1 (softest) to 5 (stiffest). More blades = stiffer, less roll, understeer, more responsive feel. Fewer = softer, more roll, less understeer, more grip. Consider aero: softer = more roll, less aero platform control high-speed

Damper Compression Stiffness: Paired low/high speed. 1 = min damping (least resistance), 10 = max (most resistance). Increasing = faster weight transfer, more turn-in response, less overall grip. High speed increases proportionally = harsher kerb response. Smooth tracks = more bump stiffness beneficial. Rough/aggressive kerbs = less compression for mechanical grip

Damper Rebound Stiffness: Paired low/high speed. 1 = min (least extension resistance), 10 = max (most). Increasing = slower extension. High = better platform control and response but risk tire losing contact causing oscillations

Brake Pressure Bias: % to front. Above 50% = more front pressure, forward shift, front lock tendency, more stability. Tune for preference and conditions

=== CHASSIS - FRONT CORNERS ===

Cross Weight: % of weight over RF and LR. 50.0% = optimal non-ovals, symmetrical handling. Higher = understeer left turns, oversteer right. Changed via corner springs, air pressures, alignment

Corner Weight: Static weight per tire. Critical for optimization. Not easily influenced (individual corner pushrods non-adjustable). Asymmetric setups may show differences

Ride Height: Reference from ground to chassis point. May not reflect actual clearance. Low = better aero/mechanical. Increasing front = less front/overall downforce, more weight transfer. Decreasing = more front/overall downforce, less transfer. Minimum legal: 20.0mm

Spring Rate: Six options 88-175 N/mm (500-1000 lbs/in). Stiffer = smaller height variance, better aero platform, increased tire load variation, less mechanical grip. Drawbacks worse on rough tracks. Changes affect roll and pitch - consider ARB changes to retain roll stiffness. Reducing spring = increase ARB for same roll stiffness. Adjust pushrod offsets after spring changes

Caster: Vertical angle of steering axis (side view). Positive = leaned rearward. More caster = larger trail, heavier steering feel, possible feedback loss, more dynamic camber at large angles (good for chicanes/hairpins), more jacking effect (lifts inside front, lowers outside front, unloads/lifts inside rear for rotation)

Camber: Negative recommended. Higher negative = more cornering force, less braking grip, reduced tire life. Balance life vs performance. Increasing front = more mid-high speed grip, less braking, needs rearward brake bias shift

Toe-In: Negative (toe-out) = more turn-in, less stability. Positive (toe-in) = more stability, sluggish response

=== CHASSIS - REAR CORNERS ===

Spring Rate: Six options 88-175 N/mm (500-1000 lbs/in). Stiffer = smaller height variance, better aero, less mechanical grip (especially slow corner exits, aggressive throttle, rough tracks). Match to track needs. Balance high/low speed handling. Example: high-speed understeer + low-speed oversteer = increase rear spring (allows lower static rear height for less slow-speed transfer, maintains/increases high-speed rear height for forward aero shift). Adjust pushrod offsets after changes

Camber: Negative recommended. Slightly less than front (rear wider, must drive forward). Higher negative = more lateral grip, less longitudinal traction

Toe-In: Typical to run toe-in. Increasing = better stability, less direction change response. Avoid large values (increases drag, reduces speed). Keep equal L/R to prevent crabbing/asymmetric handling. Heavily asymmetric tracks (e.g., Lime Rock Park) may benefit from asymmetric toe and other parameters

=== CHASSIS - REAR ===

Rear Ride Height: Reference from ground to rear chassis centerline. Increasing = less rear downforce %, more overall downforce, more weight transfer. Decreasing = more rear downforce %, less overall downforce, less transfer. Critical for mechanical and aero balance. Match static height to chosen springs. Minimum legal: 30.0mm, Maximum legal: 40.0mm

Pushrod Offset: Adjusts rear height via pushrod length. Longer = higher, shorter = lower. Paired adjustment

ARB Blades: 1 (softest) to 5 (stiffest). Increasing stiffness = stiffer, less roll, oversteer, quicker "set" at turn-in. Decreasing = softer, more roll, less oversteer, less-responsive rear transients, more grip

Damper Compression Stiffness: Paired low/high speed. Identical ranges to front. Increasing = faster weight transfer, more response, less overall grip (especially exit traction). Excessively stiff = poor traction rough tracks (large tire load variation)

Damper Rebound Stiffness: Paired low/high speed. Identical ranges to front. Increasing = slower extension. High = better platform/response but risk losing contact. Detrimental during braking/initial turn-in. Increase can slow pitch change on brake application, potentially increasing braking stability

Fuel Level: Tank capacity 40L (10.6g). Adjustable in 1L (0.26g) increments

=== SETUP APPROACH ===

Aerodynamic Balance: Two parts - direct garage options (wings, static heights) and dynamic options (springs/torsion bars affect at-speed heights, dampers affect transient motion). All interact to determine balance through corner types

Mechanical Balance: Roll stiffness options (ARBs, springs, dampers in transient) and differential. Monitor total roll stiffness and front/rear balance. Third/heave springs affect pitch only without affecting roll/mechanical balance

Tire Contact Patch: Camber and toe behave independently. Easy to tweak anytime but difficult to optimize if other settings induce undesirable behaviors

When Uncertain: If unsure if change helps, experiment with different setting. Likely another option inducing undesirable behavior covering up current adjustment details
