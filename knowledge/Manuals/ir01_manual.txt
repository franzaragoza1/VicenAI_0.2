=== TIRES ===

Tire Compound:
- Soft: Most grip, lower lap times, wear quickly
- Medium: Moderate grip/life balance
- Hard: Least grip, slower lap times, last much longer

Cold Air Pressure: Set on load. Higher = less drag/heat, less grip. Lower = more drag/heat, more grip. Tire pressures flash on display until 21 psi (tires "settle in", build heat slower for long run)

Hot Air Pressure: Compare cold vs hot for balance. Heavier-loaded tires show larger difference. Adjust cold so similar tires reach similar hot pressures

Tire Temperatures: Carcass temps via Pyrometer. Center temps compare work. Inner/Outer analyze alignment. Three zones across tread

Tread Remaining: Identifies alignment issues (excessive one-sided wear). Use with temps for balance analysis. Three zones across tread

=== CHASSIS - OVERVIEW ===

Simplified suspension: No dedicated corner springs. Heave (pitch) and roll handled independently via Heave Springs and Anti-Roll Bars. Aero tuned via Heave Springs for efficient platform. Roll and mechanical balance tuned via ARBs

=== CHASSIS - FRONT ===

ARB Stiffness: Adjusts roll stiffness via diameter change. Increasing = stiffer, less roll, understeer, more responsive feel. Decreasing = softer, more roll, less understeer, less responsive, more grip

ARB Blades: Alters overall ARB assembly stiffness. Higher values = more force through arms, stiffer, understeer (fine-tuning vs diameter). Lower = less force, softer, less understeer

Pushrod Delta: Changes overall pushrod length, affects front ride height. Increasing = raise front. Decreasing = lower front. Mono-shock design = both pushrods equal, prevents crossweight changes. Alters height without affecting heave spring preload

Nose Weight: % weight on front tires. Rough longitudinal CoG approximation. Influences high-speed stability. Higher = more stable (good low-grip tracks, extra front downforce). Lower = good high-grip tracks, high rear downforce

Spring Perch Offset: Changes static load of front heave spring via adjustable perch. Alters overall front ride height and static deflection/preload in heave spring

Spring Rate: Heave spring. Vertical movement resistance only, no roll effect. Controls increasing aero loads, maintains proper aero attitude. Higher = stiffer vertical, maintain low front height, loss of grip over bumps. Softer = more travel, less aero control, better mechanical grip

Spring Deflection: Heave spring compression from total length under static load. Shows current state

Bump Stiffness: Resistance to compression. Affects vertical (heave) movements only. Fine-tunes aero platform. Increasing = more resistance to compression (reduction in front ride height). Lower = front compresses easier

Rebound Stiffness: Resistance to extension. Heave only. Increasing = controls unwanted vertical oscillations. Too high = suspension can't work over load changes, front grip loss over bumps

=== CHASSIS - CORNERS (ALL FOUR) ===

Corner Weight: Weight on each wheel static in garage. Determines weight distribution

Ride Height: Distance from ground to chassis bottom reference point

Camber: Negative recommended all four wheels. Higher negative = more cornering force, less braking grip. Excessive = high cornering but reduced life. Balance life vs performance

Toe-In: Front: Toe-out = increase slip inside tire, increase stability and turn-in responsiveness. Toe-in = reduce turn-in, reduce temp buildup. Rear: Toe-in = more stability, may hurt direction changes

=== CHASSIS - REAR ===

ARB Stiffness: Adjusts roll stiffness via diameter change. Increasing = stiffer, less roll, oversteer. Decreasing = softer, more roll, less oversteer, less responsive, more grip

ARB Blades: Alters overall ARB assembly stiffness. Higher = more force through arms, stiffer, oversteer (fine-tuning vs diameter). Lower = less force, softer, less oversteer

Pullrod Delta: Changes overall pullrod length, affects rear ride height. Increasing = lower rear. Decreasing = raise rear. Mono-shock design = both pullrods equal, prevents crossweight changes. Alters height without affecting heave spring preload

Spring Perch Offset: Changes static load of rear heave spring via adjustable perch. Alters overall rear ride height and static deflection/preload in heave spring

Spring Rate: Heave spring. Vertical movement resistance only, no roll effect. Controls increasing aero loads, maintains proper aero attitude. Higher = stiffer vertical, consistent rear height, loss of grip over bumps. Softer = more travel, less aero control, better mechanical grip

Spring Deflection: Heave spring compression from total length under static load

Bump Stiffness: Resistance to compression. Affects vertical (heave) movements only. Fine-tunes aero platform. Increasing = more resistance. Lower = rear compresses easier

Rebound Stiffness: Resistance to extension. Heave only. Increasing = controls unwanted vertical oscillations. Too high = suspension can't work over load changes, rear grip loss over bumps

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - AERO ===

Front Wing Angle: Angle of Attack of front wing elements. Increasing = more downforce, more drag. Decreasing = less downforce, less drag. Heavy influence on front downforce, large effect front-end grip mid-high speed corners

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - GEARBOX ===

Final Drive: Alters top speed and acceleration. Lower values = higher top speed, slower acceleration. Higher = reduced top speed, better acceleration

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - DIFFERENTIAL ===

Coast Ramp Angle: Affects differential under deceleration. Higher numbers = less locking force. Lower = more locking force. More locking = more understeer deceleration

Drive Ramp Angle: Affects differential under acceleration. Higher numbers = less locking force. Lower = more locking force. More locking = more understeer but helps traction

Clutch Plates: Number of clutch faces affects overall locking force. Multiplier effect - more faces = increasingly more locking force

Preload: Static preload applied to friction surfaces. Higher = more locking in all conditions, understeer acceleration/deceleration, mid-corner understeer (less unlock)

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - ENGINE IN-CAR ===

Throttle Shaping (PEDAL in-car):
- Setting 1: S-shaped torque map (lower torque at low inputs, rapidly increasing)
- Setting 2: More linear than 1, more S-curved than 3
- Setting 3: Linear torque map (equal torque increase per throttle %)

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - FUEL ===

Fuel Level: Amount in tank when leaving garage

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - BRAKE SYSTEM ===

Front Master Cylinder: Larger = less front pressure, rearward bias, "softer" feel. Smaller = more front pressure, forward bias, more aggressive feel

Rear Master Cylinder: Larger = less rear pressure, forward bias, "softer" feel. Smaller = more rear pressure, rearward bias, more aggressive feel

Brake Pressure Bias: % to front brakes. Above 50% = more front. Below 50% = more rear. Tune for preference and conditions

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - STEERING ===

Steering Pinion Ratio: Value represents steering rack movement per pinion revolution. Larger values = faster steering feel

=== VEHICLE SYSTEMS - DASH CONFIG ===

Display Page: Sets default page on steering wheel at load (no performance effect)
