- [Other brake temp states not detailed in manual]

=== OVERTAKE SYSTEM ===

On-demand power boost: ~5% increase via increased fuel flow limit

Availability:
- Test/Practice: Unlimited use, no time limit
- Qualifying: Disabled
- Race: 200 seconds total, 100-110 second delay between uses (track dependent)

Operation:
- Active: Green overlay, countdown timer, bar showing remaining time, left LEDs flash green
- Resetting: Blue/red bar left side, left LEDs flash purple, ReTime counts from 100
- Available: Left LEDs blue
- Under 20s remaining: Red overlay, red LEDs instead of green
- Depleted: OT Left and ReTime show "0"

Full Course Caution: System deactivates if active, ReTime resets to 100, unavailable during caution, immediately available at green flag

=== TIRES ===

Cold Pressure: Set on load. Higher = less drag/heat, less grip. Lower = more drag/heat, more grip

Last Hot Pressure: Compare cold vs hot for balance analysis. Heavier-loaded tires show larger difference. Adjust cold so similar tires reach similar hot pressures

Last Temps: Carcass temps within tread. Center temps compare work. Inner/Outer analyze alignment and pressure

Tread Remaining: Identifies alignment issues. Never prioritize over temps for balance

=== AERODYNAMICS ===

Front Flap Angle: Higher = more front downforce, forward aero, more drag. Lower = less downforce, rearward aero, less drag

Rear Wing Angle: Higher = more downforce/drag, rearward aero. Lower = less downforce/drag, forward aero

Rear Gurney Flap: Wicker on trailing edge. Two sizes available. Larger = more downforce/drag than smaller

Aero Calculator (reference tool - rear wing changes apply to car, heights don't):
- Rear RH at Speed: Input from telemetry for calculations
- Front Downforce: % on front axle. Monitor during setup to prevent unexpected changes
- Downforce to Drag: Efficiency ratio. Higher = efficient, lower = slippery

=== CHASSIS - FRONT ===

ARB Diameter: 15mm (5/8"), 18mm (11/16"), or 30mm (1 3/16") with 3mm hollow bore. Larger = stiffer, less grip, understeer, flatter. Smaller = softer, more grip, less understeer, more roll

ARB Position: Higher number = stiffer, understeer. Lower = softer, less understeer

Heave Spring Rate: Vertical travel control. Stiffer = less travel, consistent aero, less mechanical grip. Softer = more mechanical grip, excessive movement

Heave Spring Gap: Compression needed before spring loads. Positive = unloaded static, needs compression. Negative = preloaded. Lower = engages sooner, higher = delayed engagement. Changes with other settings affecting ride height

Brake Pressure Bias: % to front. Higher = more front, understeer, risks front lock. Lower = more rear, oversteer, risks rear lock. Set to avoid lockups

Display Page: Default startup (no performance effect)

=== CHASSIS - FRONT CORNERS ===

Corner Weight: Static weight on wheel. For visualizing distribution

Ride Height: Reference from ground to chassis centerline. Not actual ground clearance. Low = good aero/mechanical but avoid track contact. Affects balance, downforce, drag

Pushrod Length: Turnbuckle adjuster for height. Longer = raise front, shorter = lower. Adjusted symmetrically

Torsion Bar: Outer diameter changes stiffness. Stiffer = less movement, less mechanical grip, understeer. Softer = more movement, more grip, less/more understeer. Larger = stiffer, smaller = softer

Bump Stiffness: Low shock piston speed compression resistance. Higher = more resistance, understeer under braking. Lower = more compliant, less understeer. Higher slows vertical movement for stable aero

Rebound Stiffness: Low speed extension resistance. Higher = better aero control, on-throttle understeer, risk of unloading. Lower = maintain grip, less understeer

Camber: Negative recommended. Higher negative = more cornering force in camber direction, more aggressive turn-in, less braking

Toe-In: Negative (toe-out) = more turn-in, less stability. Positive (toe-in) = more stability, sluggish response

=== CHASSIS - REAR CORNERS ===

Corner Weight: Static weight. For visualizing distribution

Ride Height: Reference from ground to chassis centerline. Not actual clearance. Affects balance, downforce, drag

Pushrod Length: Turnbuckle adjuster. Longer = raise rear, shorter = lower. Symmetrical

Spring Rate: Force per displacement. Stiffer = less movement, better aero, less mechanical grip, oversteer slow corners. Softer = more movement, more grip, less/more oversteer

Bump Stiffness: Low speed compression. Higher = more resistance, understeer on throttle. Lower = less understeer. Higher slows vertical movement for stable aero

Rebound Stiffness: Low speed extension. Higher = better aero, understeer under braking, risk unloading. Lower = oversteer under braking

Camber: Negative recommended. Higher negative = more cornering force (stability high-speed), less on-throttle traction

Toe-In: Negative = front farther from center. Positive = front closer. Toe-in = more stability, less rotation. Lower toe-in (toward toe-out) = quicker response, unstable feel

=== CHASSIS - REAR ===

Fuel Level: Amount in tank at load

ARB Diameter: 15mm (5/8") or 17mm (11/16"). Larger = stiffer, less roll, oversteer, flatter. Smaller = softer, more roll, less oversteer, more grip

3rd Spring Rate: Heave only. Prevents dropping under heavy aero loads or vertical forces. Allows softer corner springs for mechanical grip. Stiffer = less vertical travel, consistent aero, less mechanical grip at low speeds. Softer = more travel

3rd Spring Gap: Compression needed before loading. Positive = unloaded static. Negative = preloaded. Lower = engages sooner, higher = delayed. Changes with other settings

=== DIFFERENTIAL ===

Clutch Plates: Multiplies locking force by number of plates. More = understeer off-throttle, oversteer on-throttle. Fewer = oversteer off-throttle, understeer on-throttle

Preload: Static locking always present. More = understeer braking, oversteer throttle. Less = oversteer braking, understeer throttle

Drive Angle: Locking force during acceleration. Higher = less force, oversteer on initial throttle. Lower = more force, understeer

Coast Angle: Locking force during deceleration. Higher = less force, oversteer under braking. Lower = more force, understeer

=== ENGINE IN-CAR DIALS ===

Throttle Shaping (TPS): Controls torque delivery through pedal travel. Low = butterfly-style (less at low throttle, high increase mid-range, slower at high). High = linear (consistent increase). Adjustable in-car

Launch Control RPM (Start Limit): Max RPM at full throttle when stationary with LC armed. Reduces wheelspin on low-grip starts. LC button mappings in Options>Control under Traction Control
