=== TIRES ===

Tire Type:
- Dry: Slick for dry conditions
- Wet: Treaded for wet surfaces

Cold Pressure: Set on load. Higher = less drag/heat, less grip. Lower = more drag/heat, more grip. Start low and increase as needed

Last Hot Pressure: Compare cold vs hot to analyze balance. Heavier-loaded tires show larger cold-hot difference. Adjust cold pressures so similar tires reach similar hot pressures

Last Temperatures: Carcass temps within tread. Center temps compare tire work. Inner/Outer analyze alignment and pressure

Tread Remaining: Identifies alignment issues. Never prioritize over temps for balance analysis

=== AERODYNAMICS ===

Aero Package:
- High DF: Most downforce, most drag
- Medium DF: Balanced, allows either flap config
- Low DF: Least downforce, least drag
Note: Changing package may change wing limits - monitor Aero Balance

Front Flap Configuration:
- High DF: More downforce/drag (required with High DF package)
- Low DF: Less downforce/drag (required with Low DF package)
- Medium DF package: Either flap allowed

Front Flap Angle: Higher = more downforce, forward aero, more drag. Lower = less downforce, rearward aero, less drag

Front Flap Gurney Flap: 5mm or 10mm wicker or remove. Installed = significant downforce/drag increase, forward balance. Removed = large drag reduction, rearward balance

Rear Upper Flap Angle: Higher = more downforce/drag, rearward aero. Lower = less downforce/drag, forward aero

Rear Beam Wing Angle: Lower element above axle. Higher = more downforce, rearward aero. Lower = forward aero, less downforce

Aero Calculator (reference tool only - doesn't affect setup):
- Front/Rear RH at Speed: Input on-track heights from telemetry
- Aero Balance: % downforce on front. Monitor to prevent unexpected changes
- Drag Trim: Drag offset from base (higher = more drag)
- Downforce Trim: Downforce offset from base (higher = more downforce)
- Balance Trim: Center of pressure shift (higher = forward, lower = rearward)
- Downforce to Drag: Efficiency ratio

=== CHASSIS - FRONT ===

Heave Spring: Controls vertical travel. Stiffer = less travel, consistent aero, less mechanical grip over bumps. Softer = more mechanical grip, excessive movement

Heave Perch Offset: Preloads heave spring. Decreasing = preload spring, raise ride height. Increasing = unload spring, lower ride height

Heave Spring Deflection: Compression from free length. Not directly adjustable. Higher = more preload, lower = relaxed

Heave Damper Deflection: Travel available before bottoming. Shows position, not loading

Pushrod Length Offset: Changes ride height without affecting preload. Set springs first, then adjust height. Longer = higher, shorter = lower

ARB Size: Anti-roll stiffness. Stiffer = more roll stiffness, understeer. Softer/disconnected = less stiffness, less understeer, may hurt aero

ARB Arm Length: Longer = softer ARB, oversteer. Shorter = stiffer ARB, understeer

ARB Blades: #1 softest to #5 stiffest. Stiffer = understeer, softer = less understeer. (In-car: FARB)

=== CHASSIS - FRONT CORNERS ===

Ride Height: Reference from ground to chassis. Lower = better for aero/mechanical but avoid track contact. Affects aero balance, downforce, drag

Spring Deflection: Compression from free length under static load. Shows preload

Shock Deflection: Compression from free length. Shows available travel before springs/packers engage

Torsion Bar Preload: Adjusts height and corner weight. Decreasing = more preload, more weight, higher height. Adjust in pairs to prevent crossweight changes

Torsion Bar Outer Diameter: Changes stiffness. Stiffer (larger) = less front movement, less mechanical grip, understeer. Softer (smaller) = more movement, more grip, less understeer

Compression Damping: Low-speed resistance. Higher = faster weight transfer, understeer. Lower = slower transfer, less understeer

Rebound Damping: Low-speed extension resistance. Higher = better aero control, on-throttle understeer, risk of wheel unloading. Lower = maintain grip longer, less understeer, more splitter lift. Excessive causes oscillations

Camber: Negative recommended. Higher negative = more cornering force, less braking. Asymmetric for directional tracks

Toe-In: Negative (toe-out) = more turn-in, less stability. Positive (toe-in) = more stability, sluggish response

=== CHASSIS - REAR CORNERS ===

Spring Deflection: Compression from free length. Shows preload

Shock Deflection: Compression from free length. Shows travel before springs/packers

Spring Perch Offset: Adjusts height and weight. Decreasing = more preload, more weight, higher height. Adjust in pairs to prevent crossweight changes

Spring Rate: Force per displacement. Stiffer = better aero, less mechanical grip. Softer = better over bumps, more grip, hurts aero. Must be symmetrical (homologation)

Compression Damping: Low-speed resistance. Higher = faster transfer, understeer on throttle. Lower = less understeer on throttle

Rebound Damping: Low-speed extension resistance. Higher = better aero control, understeer under braking. Lower = oversteer under braking

=== CHASSIS - REAR ===

Camber: Negative recommended. Higher negative = more cornering force, less braking grip. Balance life vs performance

Toe-In: Positive toe-in = more stability, may hurt direction changes. Symmetric recommended

Ride Height: Reference from ground to chassis centerline. Affects aero balance, downforce, drag

Third Spring: Resists vertical travel only, not roll. Crucial for controlling rear height and maximizing rear downforce

Third Perch Offset: Adjusts static third spring load and front ride height [note: manual says front but likely means rear]

Third Spring Deflection: Compression from free length. Not directly adjustable. Higher = more preload

Third Damper Deflection: Travel available before bottoming. Shows position only

Pushrod Length Offset: Changes height without affecting preload. Set springs first, then adjust. Longer = higher, shorter = lower

ARB Size: Roll stiffness. Larger = stiffer, less roll, understeer, more responsive feel. Smaller = softer, more roll, less understeer, more grip

ARB Arm Length: Longer = softer, understeer. Shorter = stiffer, oversteer

=== BRAKES / IN-CAR / MISC ===

Display Page: Default startup page (no performance effect)

Front Master Cylinder: Larger = less front pressure, rearward bias, more pedal effort. Smaller = more front pressure, forward bias, less effort

Rear Master Cylinder: Larger = less rear pressure, forward bias, more effort. Smaller = more rear pressure, rearward bias, less effort

Brake Pressure Bias: % to front. Higher = more front, understeer under braking. Lower = more rear, oversteer. Set to avoid lockups

Fuel Level: Amount in tank at load

Crossweight: % over RF and LR wheels. Higher = understeer in left turns, oversteer in right. Lower = oversteer in left, understeer in right

Gear Stack: 5 options. Shorter = better acceleration, lower top speed. Longer = higher top speed, less acceleration. Match to track

Top Speed: Estimated from gear stack

=== DIFFERENTIAL ===

Ramp Angles: Power (accel) and Coast (decel). Lower angle = more locking. Higher = less locking
- Coast: More locking (lower) = understeer. Less locking (higher) = oversteer
- Power: More locking (lower) = oversteer. Less locking (higher) = understeer

Clutch Friction Faces: Multiplies locking force. More faces = more understeer off-throttle, more oversteer on-throttle. Fewer = more oversteer off-throttle, more understeer on-throttle

Preload: Static locking always present. More = understeer braking, oversteer throttle. Less = oversteer braking, understeer throttle

=== SETUP TIPS ===

Tech Inspection Failures: Likely ride heights. Use P-rod Length Offset (right click/positive = raise, left click/negative = lower)

iRacing Setup Types:
- Baseline: 50% fuel, max downforce, passes all fuel loads, not max performance
- Low/Medium/High DF: 50% fuel, use when no track-specific setup
- _wet: Wet tires pre-fitted
- Track specific: Fueled for series finish

Starting Point: Use High Downforce setup if track not listed

Third/Heave Springs: Adjust pitch motion and dynamic ride heights without affecting roll. Major effect on pitch. Use with torsion bars/springs

Front Ride Height: Generally run as low as possible for more downforce

Aerodynamic Balance: Two parts - direct garage settings (wings, static heights) and dynamic settings (springs affect on-track heights, dampers affect transient motion). Aero active even in slow corners. Settings affecting dynamic heights also affect roll and mechanical balance. Third/heave springs affect pitch only, not roll

Mechanical Balance: Roll stiffness (ARBs, springs, dampers) and differential. Monitor total roll stiffness and front/rear balance

Gear Stack: Use shortest possible without over-revving 6th on longest straight. Shorter = better acceleration

Tire Contact Patch: Camber and toe behave independently. Easy to tweak anytime but hard to optimize if other settings induce undesirable behavior

Final Note: If unsure if change helps, try adjusting different setting - may be another option covering up the detail you're adjusting
