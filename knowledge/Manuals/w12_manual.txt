=== TIRE COMPOUNDS ===

Soft (Red): High grip, shorter life, faster pace
Medium (Yellow): Balanced grip/life/pace
Hard (White): Lower grip, longer life, slower pace
Race rule: Must start on qualifying compound

=== TIRE SETTINGS ===

Starting Pressure: Set cold. Higher = less drag/heat, less grip. Lower = more drag/heat, more grip
Last Hot Pressure: Compare cold vs hot to analyze balance. Similar tires should build pressure at similar rates
Tire Temps O/M/I: Carcass temps show wheel loads and work done. Center temps compare tire work. Inner/Outer analyze alignment
Tread Remaining: Indicates alignment issues but never prioritize over temperatures

=== AERODYNAMICS ===

Downforce Trim:
- High: Most grip, most drag
- Medium: Balanced
- Low: Least grip, least drag

Front Flap Offset: Higher = more downforce, forward aero balance. Lower = less downforce, rearward balance, less drag

Rear Wing Gurney: Increases height = more rear downforce and drag, rearward balance. Decreases = less downforce/drag, forward balance

Aero Calculator:
- Front/Rear RH at Speed: Input on-track heights from telemetry to calculate aero balance
- Aero Balance: Percentage of downforce on front axle. Monitor to prevent unexpected changes
- Downforce to Drag: Efficiency ratio. Higher = efficient, lower = slippery/low-drag

=== CHASSIS - FRONT ===

Weight Distribution: Higher % = weight forward, more stable at speed, less rotation. Lower % = weight rear, twitchier at speed, more rotation

Heave Rate: Controls vertical travel. Stiffer = less travel, better aero, less mechanical grip. Softer = more mechanical grip, risk of bottoming

Roll Rate: Higher = stiffer, less roll, more understeer, less camber change. Lower = softer, more roll, less understeer, more camber change

Ride Height: Lower front = more downforce, forward aero balance, less drag

=== CHASSIS - FRONT CORNERS ===

Camber: Negative recommended. Higher negative = more cornering in camber direction, less braking. Use asymmetric for directional tracks

Toe-In: Negative (toe-out) = more turn-in, less stability. Positive (toe-in) = more stability, sluggish response

=== CHASSIS - REAR ===

Fuel Level: Adjustable, can be removed for setup work

Heave Rate: Controls vertical travel. Greatly influences rake angle, affecting downforce and balance. Stiffer = less travel, better aero. Softer = better mechanical grip, risk of bottoming

Roll Rate: Higher = stiffer, less roll, more oversteer. Lower = softer, more roll, less oversteer

Ride Height: Higher rear = more overall downforce, forward balance, more drag

=== CHASSIS - REAR CORNERS ===

Camber: Negative recommended. More camber = more stability at high speed/load, less traction on throttle. Use asymmetric for directional tracks

Toe-In: Each wheel adjustable individually. Positive toe-in = more stability, helps throttle application. Less toe-in = better rotation, less stable

=== DIFFERENTIAL ===

Entry Preload: Static locking during deceleration only. More = understeer on decel. Less = oversteer on decel

Entry: Deceleration/turn-in phase. Higher = more locking, understeer. Lower = less locking, oversteer. (In-car: ENTRY)

Middle: Transition between decel/accel. Higher = understeer on decel, oversteer on accel. Lower = oversteer on decel, understeer on accel. (In-car: MID)

High Speed: Acceleration/heavy throttle. Higher = more locking, oversteer. Lower = less locking, understeer. (In-car: HISPD)

=== POWER UNIT ===

MGU-K Deploy Modes (4 changes per lap max):

No Deploy (Qual/Practice only): No electrical deployment, charges battery fully

Qual (Qual/Practice only): Deploys nearly all energy over one lap. Use after No Deploy on out lap

Attack (Practice/Race only): Aggressive draw for overtaking. Use sparingly, costs performance to recharge. Use end of race or critical overtakes

Balanced (Practice/Race only): Maintains 80% SoC average. Takes 2-3 laps to stabilize from 100%. Primary race mode

Build (Practice/Race only): Targets 100% SoC. Use when desperate to build charge. Stop using once stabilized to avoid energy loss

Engine Braking: Lower setting = more engine braking, more oversteer off-throttle. Higher = less braking, more understeer. (In-car: EB)

=== BRAKE SYSTEM ===

Base Brake Bias: % to front brakes. Higher = more front, stable but risks front lock, slight understeer. Lower = more rear, easier turn-in, risks rear lock/spin. (In-car: BBAL)

Dynamic Ramping: Sets pedal travel point where bias ramping begins

Brake Migration: Shifts bias forward 1-9% (setting 1-10) past ramping point at full pedal. Adapts to high aero loads at speed. (In-car: BMIG)

Total Brake Bias: Maximum bias at full pedal = Base + Migration

Brake Magic Modifier: Pre-set heavy front bias for heating brakes/tires on warm-up laps. Garage value as decimal (0.75 = 75%)
