COACH DAVE ACADEMY - IRACING SETUP GUIDE

=== SETUP PHILOSOPHY ===

Goal: Create setups tailored not just for a fast qualifying lap but for consistent performance across entire race stints.
Compromise: Every adjustment is a tradeoff (e.g., grip vs. top speed, stability vs. rotation).
Qualifying vs. Race:
- Qualifying: Aggressive, maximizes grip at the cost of tyre life and fuel consumption.
- Race: Prioritizes consistency, drivability, and tyre preservation over raw one-lap pace.
Testing: The best way to know what works is to test, test, and test some more.

=== TYRES ===

Compounds:
- Soft: Fastest but high wear. Rapid early performance, drops off quickly.
- Medium: Balanced. Slower than soft but maintains grip longer.
- Hard: Slowest but most durable.

Pressures:
- Affects contact patch and heat generation.
- Lower Pressure: Increases grip and rolling resistance/heat.
- Higher Pressure: Reduces drag and heat, decreases grip but improves responsiveness.

Management:
- Crucial for RWD high-power cars (e.g., GTP/LMDh). Smooth throttle and "lift and coast" help manage rear tyre temps.

=== AERODYNAMICS ===

General Rule: More aero = Better grip but reduced top speed (Drag).
Aero Balance:
- Front Aero: Increasing reduces understeer, increases front grip.
- Rear Aero: Increasing reduces oversteer, increases rear grip.
- Balance: Vital to keep front/rear values aligned to prevent instability.

Ride Height (Rake):
- Controls mechanical grip and aero platform.
- Lower Front: Shifts balance forward (Rear Oversteer).
- Lower Rear: Shifts balance rearward (Understeer).
- Stalling: Too low can cause aero stall (sudden loss of downforce).

=== CHASSIS - SUSPENSION ===

Springs (Spring Rate):
- Stiff Front: Reduces load transfer to front tyres. Causes entry understeer.
- Stiff Rear: Reduces rear load transfer. Reduces bump absorption.
- Tuning Oversteer: Stiffen Front Springs (Fast corners), Soften Rear Springs (Slow corners).
- Tuning Understeer: Soften Front Springs, Stiffen Rear Springs.

Anti-Roll Bars (ARB):
- Control roll stiffness and balance in steady-state cornering.
- Stiff Front ARB: Increases Understeer (Stability).
- Stiff Rear ARB: Increases Oversteer (Rotation).

Dampers:
- Control the rate of spring compression/release.
- Slow Dampers: Manage weight transfer during braking, acceleration, and cornering.
- Fast Dampers: Manage bumps and kerbs.
- Tuning: If car is twitchy/unpredictable, reduce damper values.

=== CHASSIS - GEOMETRY ===

Toe:
- Front Toe: Adjusts turn-in response. Toe-out (negative) generally increases initial turn-in.
- Rear Toe: Controls straight-line stability. More Toe-in (positive) = More stability, Less rotation. Less Toe-in = Better rotation.

Camber:
- Negative Camber: Increases cornering grip by optimizing contact patch under load.
- Tradeoff: Excessive camber reduces braking efficiency and acceleration traction.

=== DRIVETRAIN ===

Differential (Diff):
- Preload: Force required to unlock the diff.
  - Higher Preload: More stable on exit, harder to rotate mid-corner.
  - Lower Preload: Better rotation, but car becomes more reactive/lively.
- Power/Coast Ramps: Control locking behaviour on throttle vs. braking.

Gearing:
- Adjust stack to suit track top speed and corner exit RPM.

=== BRAKES ===

Brake Bias:
- Shifts braking force between front and rear axles.
- Forward Bias: More stability, risk of front lockup (Understeer).
- Rear Bias: Better turn-in, risk of rear lockup/spin (Oversteer).
